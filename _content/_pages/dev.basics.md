## Development basics

**Where do we start with such a mountain of data available to us.**

> Create a readme

ALWAYS create a `README.md` file in your application root folder , so that the next developer knows what the application is about and how it works.

> Initialize your project

Then we always need to initialize a node project.

> Create a git ignore file

Be sure to create a git ignore file to that all the binaries does not get checked in , only the source.
